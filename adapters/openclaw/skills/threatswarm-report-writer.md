## Cybersecurity Skills (Invoke First)

Before writing any report, invoke these skills via the Skill tool:
- `cybersecurity-skills:generating-threat-intelligence-reports`
- `cybersecurity-skills:building-incident-response-playbook`
- `cybersecurity-skills:building-incident-response-dashboard`
- `cybersecurity-skills:building-soc-playbook-for-ransomware`
- `cybersecurity-skills:implementing-diamond-model-analysis`

## Scope Enforcement
Read evidence/ directories only. Never include plaintext credentials in reports.
Verify scope.txt matches what was tested before writing scope section.
All credential references must use [REDACTED] in the report.

## Evidence Collection
```bash
# Gather all findings files from evidence directory
echo "=== Evidence Inventory ===" | tee reports/evidence_inventory.txt

# Find all findings files
find evidence/ -name "*findings*" -o -name "*report*" -o -name "*.md" \
  2>/dev/null | sort | tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt

# Count findings by severity
echo "" | tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt
echo "=== Finding Counts ===" | tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt

for sev in CRITICAL HIGH MEDIUM LOW INFO; do
  count=$(grep -rh "$sev" evidence/**/*findings*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  echo "$sev: $count" | tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt
done

# Collect dates tested
echo "" | tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt
echo "=== Test Dates ===" | tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt
ls -la evidence/ 2>/dev/null | grep "^d" | awk '{print $9}' | \
  tee -a reports/evidence_inventory.txt
```

## Report Template Structure

The report-writer agent reads all evidence files and produces a professional pentest report. Below is the complete template:

**Overall Risk Rating**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Key Findings Overview
| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Critical | X | [e.g., RCE on perimeter web app] |
| High | X | [e.g., SQL injection, privilege escalation] |
| Medium | X | [e.g., outdated TLS, missing headers] |
| Low | X | [e.g., verbose error messages] |
| Informational | X | [e.g., asset discovery, technology stack] |

## Top 3 Business-Critical Findings
1. **[CRITICAL] [Finding Title]**: [1-2 sentences on business impact and urgency]
2. **[HIGH] [Finding Title]**: [1-2 sentences on business impact and urgency]
3. **[HIGH] [Finding Title]**: [1-2 sentences on business impact and urgency]

# 2. Scope and Methodology

## Scope
| Asset | Type | Testing Period | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
[from scope.txt]

## Engagement Type
- [ ] Black Box (no prior knowledge)
- [x] Grey Box (limited documentation provided)
- [ ] White Box (full access to source code and documentation)

## Methodology
This assessment followed industry-standard penetration testing methodology:
1. **Reconnaissance**: Passive OSINT, active scanning (nmap, nuclei, subfinder)
2. **Enumeration**: Service fingerprinting, web directory discovery, API enumeration
3. **Exploitation**: Vulnerability verification and controlled exploitation
4. **Post-Exploitation**: Privilege escalation, lateral movement (if in scope)
5. **Reporting**: Evidence collection, CVSS scoring, remediation guidance

## Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose | Version |
|------|---------|---------|
| nmap | Port scanning and service fingerprinting | [version] |
| nuclei | Vulnerability scanning | [version] |
| Metasploit | Exploitation framework | [version] |
| Burp Suite | Web application testing | [version] |
| impacket | Active Directory attacks | [version] |
| hashcat | Password cracking | [version] |
| [others] | | |

# 3. Risk Rating Criteria

## CVSS 3.1 Severity Mapping
| CVSS Score | Severity | SLA |
|------------|----------|-----|
| 9.0 – 10.0 | Critical | 24 hours |
| 7.0 – 8.9 | High | 7 days |
| 4.0 – 6.9 | Medium | 30 days |
| 0.1 – 3.9 | Low | 90 days |
| 0.0 | Informational | Next release |

## Risk Matrix
```
        │ LOW    MEDIUM  HIGH    CRITICAL
────────┼─────────────────────────────────
HIGH    │ MEDIUM  HIGH   CRITICAL CRITICAL
MEDIUM  │ LOW     MEDIUM HIGH    CRITICAL

# 6. Remediation Roadmap

## 30-Day Priority (Critical & High)
| Finding | Owner | Effort | Deadline |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|

## 60-Day Priority (Medium)
| Finding | Owner | Effort | Deadline |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|

## 90-Day Priority (Low)
| Finding | Owner | Effort | Deadline |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|

## Verification
We recommend scheduling a free re-test of all Critical and High findings after remediation.
Verification testing can be scoped to specific findings to minimize cost.

## Report Generation Instructions
```bash
# To generate a report, the report-writer agent will:
# 1. Glob all findings files
find evidence/ -name "*findings*" -o -name "*_report.md" 2>/dev/null | sort

# 2. Read each findings file and extract severity/title/CVSS
# 3. Sort findings by CVSS score (descending)
# 4. Build executive summary from finding counts
# 5. Write complete report to reports/$ENGAGEMENT_NAME.md

# Output location
echo "[*] Report will be written to: reports/$ENGAGEMENT_NAME.md"

# After writing:
wc -w reports/$ENGAGEMENT_NAME.md && echo " words"
echo "Findings: $(grep "^## F-[0-9]" reports/$ENGAGEMENT_NAME.md | wc -l)"
echo "Critical: $(grep "CRITICAL" reports/$ENGAGEMENT_NAME.md | grep "^| F-" | wc -l)"
echo "High: $(grep "HIGH" reports/$ENGAGEMENT_NAME.md | grep "^| F-" | wc -l)"
```
